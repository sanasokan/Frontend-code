I spent approximately 5 hours for creating the application in broser. This time includes setting up the project, writing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, testing the application, and preparing the documentation.

## 2. Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution and any other specific choices you made.

### Code Structure

- **Separation of Concerns:** I structured the code into three main files (`index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`) to maintain a clear separation of concerns:
  - `index.html` handles the structure of the webpage.
  - `style.css` is responsible for the presentation and styling of the application.
  - `script.js` contains the logic for processing the uploaded text file.
